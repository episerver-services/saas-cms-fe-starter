# ðŸ§ª Testing Strategy (Placeholder)

This document outlines the testing strategy for this frontend project. It serves as a placeholder and can be fully fleshed out if and when the client requires a comprehensive test coverage and documentation policy.

_Last updated: 29 July 2025_

## Overview

The codebase includes support for:

- **Unit Tests** using Jest and React Testing Library
- **BDD Tests** using Cucumber with Gherkin syntax
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests** using Playwright

These testing tools are pre-configured and ready to use.

---

## Unit Testing

- Located under: `app/__tests__/`
- Framework: **Jest** + **React Testing Library**
- Tests focus on individual components, utilities, and data logic.

### Example Command

```bash
pnpm test
```

---

## BDD Testing

- Located under: `features/`
- Framework: **Cucumber** with **Gherkin syntax**
- Tests simulate user journeys from a business perspective.

### Example Command

```bash
pnpm test:bdd
```

---

## E2E Testing

- Located under: `e2e/`
- Framework: **Playwright**
- Simulates real user interaction across full pages.

### Example Command

```bash
pnpm test:playwright
```

---

## Current Status

While the test frameworks are fully operational, extensive test coverage has **not** yet been implemented.

ðŸ“Œ This provides flexibility to scale testing up if the client project scope demands it.
